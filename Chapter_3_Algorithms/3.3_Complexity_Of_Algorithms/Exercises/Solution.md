![problem 8](https://github.com/cpp-rakesh/DiscreteMathematicsAndItsApplications/blob/master/Chapter_3_Algorithms/3.3_Complexity_Of_Algorithms/Exercises/repo/images/problem_8.jpg)
###Solution
#####Naive Iterative Power Algorithm, will always have worst case of n multiplication,
therefore, when n grows, the time complexity grows with n as well. But this is not the best solution
to calculate the power of base to the exponent. We can have a divide and conquer method.

#####Divide and Conquer Power Algortim, will have O(lg n) because of divide and conquer.
So when n grows time complexity will grow by lg n, which will me very efficient than n.
