![problem 2 a](https://github.com/cpp-rakesh/DiscreteMathematicsAndItsApplications/blob/master/Chapter_3_Algorithms/3.1_Algorithms/Exercises/repo/images/problem_2_a.jpg)
###Solution
1. A infinite loop because it doesnt have any exit condition.
2. It will double the value of n and will stick into while loop, missing exit condition
3. A working solution of double is below
