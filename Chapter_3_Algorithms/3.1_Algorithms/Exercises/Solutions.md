![problem 1](https://github.com/cpp-rakesh/DiscreteMathematicsAndItsApplications/blob/master/Chapter_3_Algorithms/3.1_Algorithms/Exercises/repo/problem_1.jpg)
###Solution
####A infinite loop because it doesnt have any exit condition.
####It will double the value of n and will stick into while loop, missing exit condition
####A working solution of double is below
